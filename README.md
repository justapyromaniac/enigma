# enigma

This is an application meant to replicate the functionality of the enigma machine. On top of this this application will offer some very slight differences possible because this is a digital version.

This project will eventually include a full UI for encrypting and decrypting messages, swapping out rotors, swapping ot reflectors, swapping out plugs etc etc.

At this moment however the application is pure back-end.

This application will be built using Java 17. Since I am using VSCode, lombok is currently out of the question. (the extension needs an update, no I'm not swapping to another IDE)

## Todo

[] Proper blueprint
[] Project board on github
[x] encryption of character
[x] rotor rotation
[x] rotor notches
[x] reflector
[] plugs
